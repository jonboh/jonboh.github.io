[Declarative Data Pipelines Slides](https://github.com/jonboh/declarative_data_pipelines/blob/main/presentation.md)
This is the accompanying material to a talk I gave to the students of [Deusto's Digital Industry dual degree](https://www.deusto.es/es/inicio/estudia/estudios/grado/grado-dual-industria-digital).

In this talk we walk through the skeleton of a data pipeline configured using the Nix language. We use a Nix Flake to define the system, this provides us with a completely declarative and reproducible system.

The primary aim of the talk is to introduce to students the kinds of systems that they will end up building to consume data in their professional career in a way that will allow them to reproduce the system in their own hardware.

The system presented is not intended to represent a production ready environment but an experimentation playground.
